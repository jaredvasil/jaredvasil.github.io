# Hello!

My name is Jared Vasil. I'm a developmental psychologist who studies young children's communicative, conceptual, and social development. I use experiments to investigate children's thought and language about the social world, as this provides a lens into how we come think about ourselves. This website includes my CV and publications with their data and code. The code is written in R and uses tools from [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse) for data manipulation, [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms) for modeling, and [posterior](https://cran.r-project.org/package=posterior) for posterior analysis.

**keywords**: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, Bayes
