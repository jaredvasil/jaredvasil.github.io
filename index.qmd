# Hello!

My name is Jared Vasil. I am a developmental psychologist interested in how people conceive of themselves. To study this topic, I conduct experiments of young children's social and communicative behavior. Unencumbered by the culture and complicated psychology of adults, children's social behavior provides a clear view into the content of our self conception.

In the spirit of transparency and reproducibility, this website is principally an open repository of the data that I collect and the code that I write to analyze it. [Here is my CV](papers/cv_feb26.pdf).

**keywords**: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, Bayes
