Hello! My name is Jared Vasil. I'm a developmental psychologist who studies young children's communicative and conceptual development. I use experiments to investigate how communication shapes children's thinking, and vice versa. I'm primarily interested in how children think and talk about their social world because this provides a lens into how children think about their place within it. Here you will find my most recent CV and a list of my publications with their data and code. The code is written in R and uses tools from [tidyverse](papers/tidyverse.pdf) for data manipulation, [brms](papers/brms.pdf) for modeling, and [posterior](papers/posterior.pdf) for posterior analysis.
