# Hello!

My name is Jared Vasil. I'm a developmental psychologist who studies young children's communicative, conceptual, and social development. I use experiments to investigate children's thought and language about the social world, as this provides a lens into how we come think about ourselves. This website includes my CV and publications with data and code.
