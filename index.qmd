Hello! My name is Jared Vasil. I'm a developmental psychologist who studies young children's communicative, conceptual, and social development. I use experiments to investigate children's thought and language about the social world, as this provides a lens into how we come think about ourselves. Here you will find my CV and publications with their data and code. The code is written in R and uses tools from [tidyverse](papers/tidyverse.pdf) for data manipulation, [brms](papers/brms.pdf) for modeling, and [posterior](papers/posterior.pdf) for posterior analysis.

**keywords**: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, experimental, Bayes
