    "text": "Hello!\nMy name is Jared Vasil. I am a developmental psychologist interested in how people conceive of themselves. To study this topic, I conduct experiments of young children’s social and communicative behavior. Unencumbered by the culture and complicated psychology of adults, children’s social behavior provides a clear view into the content of our self conception.\nIn the spirit of transparency and reproducibility, this website is principally an open repository of the data that I collect and the code that I write to analyze it. Here is my CV.\nkeywords: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, Bayes"

My name is bolded and my mentees’ last names are followed by an asterisk. These individuals contributed substantially to study conceptualization, design, data collection, and analysis en route to a senior thesis.\nWhere applicable, beneath each publication is its data and code. Clicking the “Data and Code” link will download a .zip file that contains a folder system with a .rproj file (i.e., an R project environment). The entire published analysis can be reproduced by running the script within the .rproj (save for any packages which may have to be installed by the user). The code is written in R and uses tools from tidyverse for data manipulation, brms for modeling, and posterior for posterior analysis. While I hope there are none, any errors in the code on this site are my responsibility.\n\nPeer-Reviewed Journal Articles\nLi, L., & Vasil, J. (2025).
