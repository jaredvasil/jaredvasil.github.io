    "text": "Hello!\nMy name is Jared Vasil. I am a developmental psychologist interested in how people conceive of themselves. To study this topic, I conduct experiments of young children’s social and communicative behavior, like joint commitment and linguistic reference. Unencumbered by the culture and complicated psychology of adults, children’s behavior provides a clear view into the content of our self conception.\nIn the spirit of transparency and reproducibility, this website is an open repository of my publications along with data and analytical code. Here is my CV.\nkeywords: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, Bayes\n\n\nPeer-Reviewed Journal Articles\nPDFs of either the published article or the accepted manuscript are hyperlinked. My name is bolded and my mentees’ last names are followed by an asterisk. These individuals contributed substantively to study conceptualization, design, data collection, and analysis en route to a senior thesis.\nWhere applicable, beneath each publication is its data and code. Clicking the “data and code” link will download a .zip file. Inside of this .zip file is a folder system with a .rproj file (i.e., an R project environment). The published analysis can be reproduced by running the .r or .rmd script within the .rproj file. The folder system is prepared so that the entire analysis pipeline - from data import to posterior inference, including figures and tables - can be completed in one command (plus commands which may be needed to install R packages). The code is written in R and principally uses tools from tidyverse for data manipulation, brms for modeling, and posterior for posterior analysis. All errors are my responsibility.\n\nLi, L., & Vasil, J. (2025). Phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and logical critiques of mental state minimalism.
