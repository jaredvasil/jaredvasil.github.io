    "text": "Hello! My name is Jared Vasil. I’m a developmental psychologist who studies young children’s communicative, conceptual, and social development. I use experiments to investigate children’s thought and language about the social world, as this provides a lens into how we come think about ourselves. This website includes my CV and publications with their data and code. The code is written in R and uses tools from tidyverse for data manipulation, brms for modeling, and posterior for posterior analysis.\nkeywords: communication, conceptualization, development, evolution, Bayes"
